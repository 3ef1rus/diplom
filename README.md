My diploma includes a voice assistant that interacts with the computer
it can perform various actions such as: creating files (also with a specific name), creating Word, Notepad, Excel, Powerpoint, searching for various information on the Internet, adjusting sound, managing computer windows, etc.
There is an interface with a chat in which the assistant communicates with the user both in text and audio format
